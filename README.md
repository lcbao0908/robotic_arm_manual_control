# Robotic Arm Control
In this code set up, I will show you how to achieve Manual Control of a Robotic Arm and Inverse Kinematic Control of a Robotic in a linear path along X, and Y coordinates with Joysticks
Electrical schematics and robotic arm photo will be provided soon for your understanding purposes of the system and the design choice.
